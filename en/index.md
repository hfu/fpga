# Field Freedom and Platform Power
{: #main-heading}

The field is where reality happens. Platforms exist to support the field, not to control it.

## Four Concepts
{: #concepts-heading}

**FF — Field Freedom**  
Systems must work offline, operate independently, and respect field constraints.

**PP — Platform Power**  
Platforms amplify field freedom. They coordinate and aggregate, but never command.

**GG — Generative Genius**  
Intelligence emerges at the edge when freedom meets constraints.

**AA — Authentic Action**  
Those who bear consequences make decisions. Action validates architecture.

## edge node
{: #edge-node-heading}

An edge node is a position in a system where decisions are made under constraints.

Connectivity is intermittent. Power is limited. Information is incomplete. Yet the work must continue.

Cloud-only assumptions fail in the field. Systems designed for continuous connectivity degrade catastrophically when that connectivity disappears. Edge nodes operate where the network is optional, not foundational.

## Design Principles
{: #principles-heading}

Six principles guide field-first system design:

- **Offline-First** — Connectivity is optimization, not requirement
- **Exit-First** — No lock-in by architecture
- **Open by Default** — Transparent, portable, inspectable
- **Field-Tested** — Reality is the standard
- **No Mandatory APIs** — Critical functions work independently
- **No Lock-In Assumptions** — Migration is always possible
