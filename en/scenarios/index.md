# Edge Node Scenarios

Edge Node Scenarios are not fiction. They are not case studies. They are **situational patterns** that demonstrate how FF, PP, GG, and AA manifest under real-world constraints.

Each scenario follows a strict structure:

1. **Situation** — Field conditions
2. **Constraint** — The hardest limit
3. **Action at the Edge (AA)** — Local decision-making
4. **Emergence (GG)** — What emerges unplanned
5. **Platform Interaction (PP)** — Optional synchronization
6. **Field Outcome (FF)** — Autonomy preserved

These scenarios are **reusable templates**. New scenarios can be added without changing the core framework.
